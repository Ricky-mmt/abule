        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Donald Trump: A Controversial Figure in American Politics</h2>
         <p style="border: 1px solid black; background-color: brown;">Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, is a figure who has left an indelible mark on <br>
        American politics. Born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, Trump started his career as a <br>
        businessman, building a real estate empire and gaining fame through his role as the host of the <br>
        reality TV show "The Apprentice."</p>

        <p style="border: 2px solid black; background-color: greenyellow;">In 2016, Trump surprised many by winning the presidential election against Democratic candidate <br>
        Hillary Clinton. His campaign was marked by controversy, characterized by his populist rhetoric,<br>
        promises to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, and pledges to "Make America Great Again."</p>

        <p style="border: 3px solid black; background-color: blueviolet;">As president, Trump's tenure was marked by a polarizing leadership style. His policies ranged from  <br>
        tax cuts and deregulation to immigration restrictions and trade tariffs. He faced numerous controversies, <br>
        including allegations of collusion with Russia during the 2016 election, conflicts of interest related <br>
        to his business empire, and divisive rhetoric on social issues.</p>

        <p style="background-color: yellow; border: 4px solid black;">Trump's presidency saw significant domestic and international challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, <br>
        which drew both praise and criticism for his administration's response. He also made unprecedented use of social <br>
        media, particularly Twitter, to communicate directly with the public, often sparking controversy with his unfiltered tweets.</p>

        <p style="background-color: indigo; border: solid green;">In 2020, Trump ran for re-election but was defeated by Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Despite contesting the election results <br> 
        and making unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud, Trump eventually conceded and left office in January 2021.</p>

        <p style="background-color: red; border: 6px solid black;">Donald Trump's impact on American politics is likely to be felt for years to come, as his presidency reshaped political norms, <br>
        tested democratic institutions, and deepened partisan divides in the United States.</p>
